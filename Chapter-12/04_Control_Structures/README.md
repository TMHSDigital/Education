# Control Structures

R supports various control structures such as if statements and loops.

## Conditional Statements

```r
x <- 10
if (x > 5) {
  print("x is greater than 5")
} else if (x == 5) {
  print("x is 5")
} else {
  print("x is less than 5")
}
```

## Loops

```r
for (i in 1:5) {
  print(i)
}
```
