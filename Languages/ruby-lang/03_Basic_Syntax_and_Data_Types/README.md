x = 5          # Integer
y = 3.14       # Float
name = "Ruby"  # String
is_active = true  # Boolean

# Array
arr = [1, 2, 3]

# Hash
hash = {name: "Ruby", age: 25}

puts x, y, name, is_active, arr, hash
```

## Basic Operators

```ruby
a = 10
b = 5

# Arithmetic operators
puts a + b  # Addition
puts a - b  # Subtraction

# Comparison operators
puts a > b  # Greater than
puts a == b # Equal to

# Logical operators
puts a > b && b < 10 # Logical AND
