# Introduction to Liquid

Liquid is a powerful, open-source templating language originally created by Shopify. It is widely used to load dynamic content on storefronts, blogs, and other web applications. Liquid allows developers to create complex templates with minimal effort, combining static HTML with dynamic content.

## Key Features

- **Objects**: Objects contain the content displayed on a page, enclosed in double curly braces `{{ }}`.
  - Example: `{{ page.title }}` outputs the title of the page.

- **Tags**: Tags are used to create logic and control flow within templates, enclosed in `{% %}`.
  - Example: `{% if user %}Hello, {{ user.name }}!{% endif %}` displays a greeting if a user is present.

- **Filters**: Filters modify the output of objects or variables. They are used within double curly braces.
  - Example: `{{ "liquid" | capitalize }}` results in `Liquid`.

## Common Use Cases

- **E-commerce**: Liquid is the backbone of Shopify themes, enabling dynamic content for products, collections, and checkout pages.
- **Static Site Generators**: Liquid is used by static site generators like Jekyll to generate dynamic web pages from static content and templates.
- **Content Management Systems**: Many CMS platforms use Liquid to render dynamic content on their pages.

## Basic Syntax

### Objects
Objects are the building blocks of Liquid templates. They are used to output dynamic content:

```liquid
{{ page.title }}
{{ user.name }}
```

### Tags
Tags provide the logic that controls the flow of the template. Common tags include `if`, `for`, and `assign`:

```liquid
{% if user %}
  Hello, {{ user.name }}!
{% endif %}

{% assign full_name = user.first_name | append: " " | append: user.last_name %}
```

### Filters
Filters are used to modify the output of objects. They can be chained together to perform multiple transformations:

```liquid
{{ "liquid" | capitalize }}
{{ "now" | date: "%Y-%m-%d" }}
```

## Conclusion

Liquid is a versatile and powerful templating language that can be used in a variety of contexts to create dynamic, engaging web content. By understanding the basics of objects, tags, and filters, developers can start creating complex templates with ease.
